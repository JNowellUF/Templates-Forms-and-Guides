    I, \textbf{#1}, would prefer to teaching in Summer #2. If that is not available, I would prefer Summer #3, and then Summer #4. Thus my order of preference is:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item #2
        \item #3
        \item #4
    \end{enumerate}
   
}

\newcommand{\nochoice}[1]{
    I, \textbf{#1}, \textbf{request no teaching assignment}. I also realize this means I will have no tuition wavier if I decide to enroll in summer courses, and I will also not be receiving a stipend (for teaching duties) during this summer. This does not necessarily impact any scholarships or non-teaching stipends I might otherwise receive.

%Instructions: Just use the \choice command with your name, then your first, second, and third choice for teaching semester. For example, if your name is John Doe and you prefer Summer C, then A, then B, use the command:
%   \choice{John Doe}{C}{A}{B}
%  That's it.
% If, instead, you wish to request NO teaching assignment, use the command \nochoice instead with your name, thus it would be:
%   \nochoice{John Doe}.

\choice{Jason Nowell}{C}{A}{B}
