    I, \textbf{#1}, \textbf{request no teaching assignment}.

The Summer \arabic{currentYear}  term dates are as follows:

%\hrule
%\vspace{5pt}
\begin{tabular}{llll}
\textbf{\Large{Semester}} & \large{Start Date} & \large{End Date} & \large{Last Day of Finals}\\\hline &&&\\

\large{\underline{\textbf{How the Tuition waiver processing for summer works:}}}

Students must be registered for classes during the semester in which they are teaching. If you are appointed summer A, you must be registered for 3 credit hours during summer A. If you are appointed summer B, you must be registered for 3 credit hours during summer B. If you are appointed summer C, you must be registered for 6 credit hours. These 6 hours may be spread out between summer A and B, summer A and C, summer B and C, or summer C.

\vspace{10pt}

\textbf{\large{Quick Reference:}} How many credits you have to take (and when) while teaching over the summer

\vspace{10pt}

\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\textbf{Term(s) You are Teaching} & \textbf{\# Credits } & \textbf{When you must be enrolled} \\\hline &&\\
Summer A & 3 & Summer A\\
Summer B & 3 & Summer B\\
1+ in each A and B & 3 each (6 total) & Summer A and B\\
Summer C & 6 & Spread across any summer semester(s).\\
\end{tabular}

Please rank your interest (and desired semester) in teaching and email your request to \dueRecipient by \dueDate.

\textit{\underline{\textbf{PLEASE NOTE:}} Due to budgetary constraints we might not be able to honor your 1st or
2nd choice regarding summer teaching.}

%Instructions: Just use the \choice command with your name, then your first, second, and third choice for teaching semester. For example, if your name is John Doe and you prefer Summer C, then A, then B, use the command:
%   \choice{John Doe}{C}{A}{B}
%  That's it.
% If, instead, you wish to request NO teaching assignment, use the command \nochoice instead with your name, thus it would be:
%   \nochoice{John Doe}.
